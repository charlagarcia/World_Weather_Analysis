## Purpose

PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. They have asked us to collect and present data from customers via the search page on their website, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find a hotel anywhere in the world.

## Overview

1. Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.
2. Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.
3. Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.
4. Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.
5. Write Python functions.
6. Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.
7. Perform linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.
8. Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.
